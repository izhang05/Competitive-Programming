  <p>Ashish and Vivek play a game on a matrix consisting of $n$ rows and $m$ columns, where they take turns claiming cells. Unclaimed cells are represented by $0$, while claimed cells are represented by $1$. The initial state of the matrix is given. There can be some claimed cells in the initial state.</p>
  <p>In each turn, a player must claim a cell. A cell may be claimed if it is unclaimed and does not share a row or column with any other already claimed cells. When a player is unable to make a move, he loses and the game ends.</p>
  <p>If Ashish and Vivek take turns to move and Ashish goes first, determine the winner of the game if both of them are playing optimally.</p>
  <p>Optimal play between two players means that both players choose the best possible strategy to achieve the best possible outcome for themselves.</p>

  <p>The first line consists of a single integer $t$ $(1 \le t \le 50)$&nbsp;— the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.</p>
  <p>The first line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers $n$, $m$ $(1 \le n, m \le 50)$&nbsp;— the number of rows and columns in the matrix.</p>
  <p>The following $n$ lines consist of $m$ integers each, the $j$-th integer on the $i$-th line denoting $a_{i,j}$ $(a_{i,j} \in \{0, 1\})$.</p>

  <p>For the first case: One possible scenario could be: Ashish claims cell $(1, 1)$, Vivek then claims cell $(2, 2)$. Ashish can neither claim cell $(1, 2)$, nor cell $(2, 1)$ as cells $(1, 1)$ and $(2, 2)$ are already claimed. Thus Ashish loses. It can be shown that no matter what Ashish plays in this case, Vivek will win. </p>
  <p>For the second case: Ashish claims cell $(1, 1)$, the only cell that can be claimed in the first move. After that Vivek has no moves left.</p>
  <p>For the third case: Ashish cannot make a move, so Vivek wins.</p>
  <p>For the fourth case: If Ashish claims cell $(2, 3)$, Vivek will have no moves left.</p>
