  <p>Omkar is standing at the foot of Celeste mountain. The summit is $n$ meters away from him, and he can see all of the mountains up to the summit, so for all $1 \leq j \leq n$ he knows that the height of the mountain at the point $j$ meters away from himself is $h_j$ meters. It turns out that for all $j$ satisfying $1 \leq j \leq n - 1$, $h_j &lt; h_{j + 1}$ (meaning that heights are strictly increasing).</p>
  <p>Suddenly, a landslide occurs! While the landslide is occurring, the following occurs: every minute, if $h_j + 2 \leq h_{j + 1}$, then one square meter of dirt will slide from position $j + 1$ to position $j$, so that $h_{j + 1}$ is decreased by $1$ and $h_j$ is increased by $1$. These changes occur simultaneously, so for example, if $h_j + 2 \leq h_{j + 1}$ and $h_{j + 1} + 2 \leq h_{j + 2}$ for some $j$, then $h_j$ will be increased by $1$, $h_{j + 2}$ will be decreased by $1$, and $h_{j + 1}$ will be both increased and decreased by $1$, meaning that in effect $h_{j + 1}$ is unchanged during that minute.</p>
  <p>The landslide ends when there is no $j$ such that $h_j + 2 \leq h_{j + 1}$. Help Omkar figure out what the values of $h_1, \dots, h_n$ will be after the landslide ends. It can be proven that under the given constraints, the landslide will always end in finitely many minutes.</p>
  <p>Note that because of the large amount of input, it is recommended that your code uses fast IO.</p>

  <p>Initially, the mountain has heights $2, 6, 7, 8$.</p>
  <p>In the first minute, we have $2 + 2 \leq 6$, so $2$ increases to $3$ and $6$ decreases to $5$, leaving $3, 5, 7, 8$.</p>
  <p>In the second minute, we have $3 + 2 \leq 5$ and $5 + 2 \leq 7$, so $3$ increases to $4$, $5$ is unchanged, and $7$ decreases to $6$, leaving $4, 5, 6, 8$.</p>
  <p>In the third minute, we have $6 + 2 \leq 8$, so $6$ increases to $7$ and $8$ decreases to $7$, leaving $4, 5, 7, 7$.</p>
  <p>In the fourth minute, we have $5 + 2 \leq 7$, so $5$ increases to $6$ and $7$ decreases to $6$, leaving $4, 6, 6, 7$.</p>
  <p>In the fifth minute, we have $4 + 2 \leq 6$, so $4$ increases to $5$ and $6$ decreases to $5$, leaving $5, 5, 6, 7$.</p>
  <p>In the sixth minute, nothing else can change so the landslide stops and our answer is $5, 5, 6, 7$.</p>
