  <p>Santa has an infinite number of candies for each of $m$ flavours. You are given a rooted tree with $n$ vertices. The root of the tree is the vertex $1$. Each vertex contains exactly one candy. The $i$-th vertex has a candy of flavour $f_i$.</p> 
  <p>Sometimes Santa fears that candies of flavour $k$ have melted. He chooses any vertex $x$ randomly and sends the subtree of $x$ to the Bakers for a replacement. In a replacement, all the candies with flavour $k$ are replaced with a new candy of the same flavour. The candies which are not of flavour $k$ are left unchanged. After the replacement, the tree is restored.</p> 
  <p>The <span class="tex-font-style-it">actual</span> cost of replacing one candy of flavour $k$ is $c_k$ (given for each $k$). The Baker keeps the price fixed in order to make calculation simple. Every time when a subtree comes for a replacement, the Baker charges $C$, no matter which subtree it is and which flavour it is.</p> 
  <p>Suppose that for a given flavour $k$ the probability that Santa chooses a vertex for replacement is same for all the vertices. You need to find out the expected value of <span class="tex-font-style-it">error</span> in calculating the cost of replacement of flavour $k$. The error in calculating the cost is defined as follows.</p> 
  <p>$$ Error\ E(k) =\ (Actual Cost\ –\ Price\ charged\ by\ the\ Bakers) ^ 2.$$</p> 
  <p>Note that the actual cost is the cost of replacement of one candy of the flavour $k$ multiplied by the number of candies in the subtree.</p> 
  <p>Also, sometimes Santa may wish to replace a candy at vertex $x$ with a candy of some flavour from his pocket.</p> 
  <p>You need to handle two types of operations: </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li> Change the flavour of the candy at vertex $x$ to $w$. </li> 
   <li> Calculate the expected value of error in calculating the cost of replacement for a given flavour $k$. </li>
  </ul>

   Input
  </div> 
  <p>The first line of the input contains four integers $n$ ($2 \leqslant n \leqslant 5 \cdot 10^4$), $m$, $q$, $C$ ($1 \leqslant m, q \leqslant 5 \cdot 10^4$, $0 \leqslant C \leqslant 10^6$) — the number of nodes, total number of different flavours of candies, the number of queries and the price charged by the Bakers for replacement, respectively.</p> 
  <p>The second line contains $n$ integers $f_1, f_2, \dots, f_n$ ($1 \leqslant f_i \leqslant m$), where $f_i$ is the initial flavour of the candy in the $i$-th node.</p> 
  <p>The third line contains $n - 1$ integers $p_2, p_3, \dots, p_n$ ($1 \leqslant p_i \leqslant n$), where $p_i$ is the parent of the $i$-th node.</p> 
  <p>The next line contains $m$ integers $c_1, c_2, \dots c_m$ ($1 \leqslant c_i \leqslant 10^2$), where $c_i$ is the cost of replacing one candy of flavour $i$.</p> 
  <p>The next $q$ lines describe the queries. Each line starts with an integer $t$ ($1 \leqslant t \leqslant 2$) — the type of the query.</p> 
  <p>If $t = 1$, then the line describes a query of the first type. Two integers $x$ and $w$ follow ($1 \leqslant  x \leqslant  n$, $1 \leqslant  w \leqslant m$), it means that Santa replaces the candy at vertex $x$ with flavour $w$.</p> 
  <p>Otherwise, if $t = 2$, the line describes a query of the second type and an integer $k$ ($1 \leqslant k \leqslant m$) follows, it means that you should print the expected value of the error in calculating the cost of replacement for a given flavour $k$.</p> 
  <p>The vertices are indexed from $1$ to $n$. Vertex $1$ is the root.</p>

   Output

  <p>Output the answer to each query of the second type in a separate line.</p> 
  <p>Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $10^{-6}$.</p> 
  <p>Formally, let your answer be $a$, and the jury's answer be $b$. The checker program considers your answer correct if and only if $\frac{|a-b|}{max(1,b)}\leqslant 10^{-6}$.</p>

   Note
  </div> 
  <p>For $1$-st query, the error in calculating the cost of replacement for flavour $1$ if vertex $1$, $2$ or $3$ is chosen are $66^2$, $66^2$ and $(-7)^2$ respectively. Since the probability of choosing any vertex is same, therefore the expected value of error is $\frac{66^2+66^2+(-7)^2}{3}$.</p> 
  <p>Similarly, for $2$-nd query the expected value of error is $\frac{41^2+(-7)^2+(-7)^2}{3}$.</p> 
  <p>After $3$-rd query, the flavour at vertex $2$ changes from $1$ to $3$.</p> 
  <p>For $4$-th query, the expected value of error is $\frac{(-7)^2+(-7)^2+(-7)^2}{3}$.</p> 
  <p>Similarly, for $5$-th query, the expected value of error is $\frac{89^2+41^2+(-7)^2}{3}$.</p>
