  <p> <span class="tex-font-style-it">Uncle Bogdan is in captain Flint's crew for a long time and sometimes gets nostalgic for his homeland. Today he told you how his country introduced a happiness index.</span></p> 
  <p>There are $n$ cities and $n−1$ undirected roads connecting pairs of cities. Citizens of any city can reach any other city traveling by these roads. Cities are numbered from $1$ to $n$ and the city $1$ is a capital. In other words, the country has a tree structure.</p> 
  <p>There are $m$ citizens living in the country. A $p_i$ people live in the $i$-th city but all of them are working in the capital. At evening all citizens return to their home cities using the shortest paths. </p> 
  <p>Every person has its own mood: somebody leaves his workplace in good mood but somebody are already in bad mood. Moreover any person can ruin his mood on the way to the hometown. <span class="tex-font-style-bf">If person is in bad mood he won't improve it</span>.</p> 
  <p>Happiness detectors are installed in each city to monitor the happiness of <span class="tex-font-style-bf">each</span> person who visits the city. The detector in the $i$-th city calculates a happiness index $h_i$ as the number of people in good mood minus the number of people in bad mood. Let's say for the simplicity that <span class="tex-font-style-it">mood of a person doesn't change inside the city</span>.</p> 
  <p>Happiness detector is still in development, so there is a probability of a mistake in judging a person's happiness. One late evening, when all citizens successfully returned home, the government asked uncle Bogdan (the best programmer of the country) to check the correctness of the collected happiness indexes.</p> 
  <p>Uncle Bogdan successfully solved the problem. Can you do the same?</p> 
  <p>More formally, <span class="tex-font-style-it">You need to check: "Is it possible that, after all people return home, for each city $i$ the happiness index will be equal exactly to $h_i$".</span></p>

  <p>The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10000$)&nbsp;— the number of test cases.</p> 
  <p>The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$; $0 \le m \le 10^9$)&nbsp;— the number of cities and citizens.</p> 
  <p>The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_{n}$ ($0 \le p_i \le m$; $p_1 + p_2 + \ldots + p_{n} = m$), where $p_i$ is the number of people living in the $i$-th city.</p> 
  <p>The third line contains $n$ integers $h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_{n}$ ($-10^9 \le h_i \le 10^9$), where $h_i$ is the calculated happiness index of the $i$-th city.</p> 
  <p>Next $n − 1$ lines contain description of the roads, one per line. Each line contains two integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ ($1 \le x_i, y_i \le n$; $x_i \neq y_i$), where $x_i$ and $y_i$ are cities connected by the $i$-th road.</p> 
  <p>It's guaranteed that the sum of $n$ from all test cases doesn't exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.</p>

  <p>Let's look at the first test case of the first sample: </p> 
  <center> 
   <img class="tex-graphics" src="https://espresso.codeforces.com/a50c755d8f12a411e2c9053a5608474da12283f8.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> 
  </center> 
  <p>At first, all citizens are in the capital. Let's describe one of possible scenarios: </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li> a person from city $1$: he lives in the capital and is in good mood; </li> 
   <li> a person from city $4$: he visited cities $1$ and $4$, his mood was ruined between cities $1$ and $4$; </li> 
   <li> a person from city $3$: he visited cities $1$ and $3$ in good mood; </li> 
   <li> a person from city $6$: he visited cities $1$, $3$ and $6$, his mood was ruined between cities $1$ and $3$; </li>
  </ul> In total, 
  <ul> 
   <li> $h_1 = 4 - 0 = 4$, </li> 
   <li> $h_2 = 0$, </li> 
   <li> $h_3 = 1 - 1 = 0$, </li> 
   <li> $h_4 = 0 - 1 = -1$, </li> 
   <li> $h_5 = 0$, </li> 
   <li> $h_6 = 0 - 1 = -1$, </li> 
   <li> $h_7 = 0$. </li>
  </ul> 
  <p>The second case of the first test: </p> 
  <center> 
   <img class="tex-graphics" src="https://espresso.codeforces.com/08e6d8b167423a0e76e87c5e0b40de93fb45fc8a.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> 
  </center> 
  <p>All people have already started in bad mood in the capital&nbsp;— this is the only possible scenario.</p> 
  <p>The first case of the second test: </p> 
  <center> 
   <img class="tex-graphics" src="https://espresso.codeforces.com/3600e6178b203bef59c624a05b4aceb8a5cf19d7.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> 
  </center> 
  <p>The second case of the second test: </p> 
  <center> 
   <img class="tex-graphics" src="https://espresso.codeforces.com/815354de06a2c42a17b0abd0a2e14d5d1742be53.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> 
  </center> 
  <p>It can be proven that there is no way to achieve given happiness indexes in both cases of the second test. </p>
