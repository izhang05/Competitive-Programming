  <p>Polycarp has recently created a new level in this cool new game Berlio Maker 85 and uploaded it online. Now players from all over the world can try his level.</p>
  <p>All levels in this game have two stats to them: the number of plays and the number of clears. So when a player attempts the level, the number of plays increases by $1$. If he manages to finish the level successfully then the number of clears increases by $1$ as well. <span class="tex-font-style-bf">Note that both of the statistics update at the same time</span> (so if the player finishes the level successfully then the number of plays will increase at the same time as the number of clears).</p>
  <p>Polycarp is very excited about his level, so he keeps peeking at the stats to know how hard his level turns out to be.</p>
  <p>So he peeked at the stats $n$ times and wrote down $n$ pairs of integers — $(p_1, c_1), (p_2, c_2), \dots, (p_n, c_n)$, where $p_i$ is the number of plays at the $i$-th moment of time and $c_i$ is the number of clears at the same moment of time. <span class="tex-font-style-bf">The stats are given in chronological order</span> (i.e. the order of given pairs is exactly the same as Polycarp has written down).</p>
  <p>Between two consecutive moments of time Polycarp peeked at the stats many players (but possibly zero) could attempt the level.</p>
  <p>Finally, Polycarp wonders if he hasn't messed up any records and all the pairs are correct. If there could exist such a sequence of plays (and clears, respectively) that the stats were exactly as Polycarp has written down, then he considers his records correct.</p>
  <p>Help him to check the correctness of his records.</p>
  <p>For your convenience you have to answer multiple independent test cases.</p>

  <p>The first line contains a single integer $T$ $(1 \le T \le 500)$ — the number of test cases.</p>
  <p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) — the number of moments of time Polycarp peeked at the stats.</p>
  <p>Each of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $p_i$ and $c_i$ ($0 \le p_i, c_i \le 1000$) — the number of plays and the number of clears of the level at the $i$-th moment of time.</p>

  <p>For each test case print a single line.</p>
  <p>If there could exist such a sequence of plays (and clears, respectively) that the stats were exactly as Polycarp has written down, then print "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>".</p>
  <p>Otherwise, print "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">NO</span>".</p>
  <p>You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).</p>

  <p>In the first test case at the third moment of time the number of clears increased but the number of plays did not, that couldn't have happened.</p>
  <p>The second test case is a nice example of a Super Expert level.</p>
  <p>In the third test case the number of plays decreased, which is impossible.</p>
  <p>The fourth test case is probably an auto level with a single jump over the spike.</p>
  <p>In the fifth test case the number of clears decreased, which is also impossible.</p>
  <p>Nobody wanted to play the sixth test case; Polycarp's mom attempted it to make him feel better, however, she couldn't clear it.</p>
