  <p>The government of Berland decided to improve network coverage in his country. Berland has a unique structure: the capital in the center and $n$ cities <span class="tex-font-style-it">in a circle</span> around the capital. The capital already has a good network coverage (so the government ignores it), but the $i$-th city contains $a_i$ households that require a connection.</p> 
  <p>The government designed a plan to build $n$ network stations between all pairs of neighboring cities which will maintain connections only for these cities. In other words, the $i$-th network station will provide service only for the $i$-th and the $(i + 1)$-th city (the $n$-th station is connected to the $n$-th and the $1$-st city).</p> 
  <p>All network stations have capacities: the $i$-th station can provide the connection to at most $b_i$ households.</p> 
  <p>Now the government asks you to check can the designed stations meet the needs of all cities or not — that is, is it possible to assign each household a network station so that each network station $i$ provides the connection to at most $b_i$ households.</p>

  <p>The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$)&nbsp;— the number of test cases.</p> 
  <p>The first line of each test case contains the single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^6$)&nbsp;— the number of cities and stations.</p> 
  <p>The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$)&nbsp;— the number of households in the $i$-th city.</p> 
  <p>The third line of each test case contains $n$ integers ($1 \le b_i \le 10^9$)&nbsp;— the capacities of the designed stations.</p> 
  <p>It's guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over test cases doesn't exceed $10^6$.</p>

  <p>In the first test case: </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li> the first network station can provide $2$ connections to the first city and $1$ connection to the second city; </li> 
   <li> the second station can provide $2$ connections to the second city and $1$ connection to the third city; </li> 
   <li> the third station can provide $3$ connections to the third city. </li>
  </ul> 
  <p>In the second test case: </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li> the $1$-st station can provide $2$ connections to the $1$-st city; </li> 
   <li> the $2$-nd station can provide $3$ connections to the $2$-nd city; </li> 
   <li> the $3$-rd station can provide $3$ connections to the $3$-rd city and $1$ connection to the $1$-st station. </li>
  </ul> 
  <p>In the third test case, the fourth city needs $5$ connections, but the fourth and the fifth station has $4$ connections in total.</p>
