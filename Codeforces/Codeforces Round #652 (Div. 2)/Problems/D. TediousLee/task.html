  <p> <span class="tex-font-style-it">Lee tried so hard to make a good div.2 D problem to balance his recent contest, but it still doesn't feel good at all. Lee invented it so tediously slow that he managed to develop a phobia about div.2 D problem setting instead. And now he is hiding behind the bushes...</span></p> 
  <p>Let's define a <span class="tex-font-style-it">Rooted Dead Bush</span> (RDB) of level $n$ as a rooted tree constructed as described below.</p> 
  <p>A rooted dead bush of level $1$ is a single vertex. To construct an RDB of level $i$ we, at first, construct an RDB of level $i-1$, then for each vertex $u$: </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li> if $u$ has no children then we will add a single child to it; </li> 
   <li> if $u$ has one child then we will add two children to it; </li> 
   <li> if $u$ has more than one child, then we will skip it. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Let's define a <span class="tex-font-style-it">claw</span> as a rooted tree with four vertices: one root vertex (called also as center) with three children. It looks like a claw:</p>

   <span class="tex-font-size-small">The center of the claw is the vertex with label $1$.</span> 
  </center> 
  <p>Lee has a Rooted Dead Bush of level $n$. Initially, all vertices of his RDB are green.</p> 
  <p>In one move, he can choose a claw in his RDB, if all vertices in the claw are <span class="tex-font-style-it">green</span> and all vertices of the claw are children of its center, then he colors the claw's vertices in yellow.</p> 
  <p>He'd like to know the maximum number of yellow vertices he can achieve. Since the answer might be very large, print it modulo $10^9+7$.</p>

  <p>It's easy to see that the answer for RDB of level $1$ or $2$ is $0$.</p> 
  <p>The answer for RDB of level $3$ is $4$ since there is only one claw we can choose: $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$.</p> 
  <p>The answer for RDB of level $4$ is $4$ since we can choose either single claw $\{1, 3, 2, 4\}$ or single claw $\{2, 7, 5, 6\}$. There are no other claws in the RDB of level $4$ (for example, we can't choose $\{2, 1, 7, 6\}$, since $1$ is not a child of center vertex $2$).</p>
