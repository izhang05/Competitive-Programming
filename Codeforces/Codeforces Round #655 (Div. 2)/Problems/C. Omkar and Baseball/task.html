  <p>Patrick likes to play baseball, but sometimes he will spend so many hours hitting home runs that his mind starts to get foggy! Patrick is sure that his scores across $n$ sessions follow the identity permutation (ie. in the first game he scores $1$ point, in the second game he scores $2$ points and so on). However, when he checks back to his record, he sees that all the numbers are mixed up! </p> 
  <p>Define a special exchange as the following: choose any subarray of the scores and permute elements such that no element of subarray gets to the same position as it was before the exchange. For example, performing a special exchange on $[1,2,3]$ can yield $[3,1,2]$ but it cannot yield $[3,2,1]$ since the $2$ is in the same position. </p> 
  <p>Given a permutation of $n$ integers, please help Patrick find the minimum number of special exchanges needed to make the permutation sorted! It can be proved that under given constraints this number doesn't exceed $10^{18}$.</p> 
  <p>An array $a$ is a subarray of an array $b$ if $a$ can be obtained from $b$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.</p>

  <p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$). Description of the test cases follows.</p> 
  <p>The first line of each test case contains integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$) &nbsp;— the length of the given permutation.</p> 
  <p>The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n}$ ($1 \leq a_{i} \leq n$) &nbsp;— the initial permutation.</p> 
  <p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.</p>

  <p>In the first permutation, it is already sorted so no exchanges are needed.</p> 
  <p>It can be shown that you need at least $2$ exchanges to sort the second permutation.</p>
