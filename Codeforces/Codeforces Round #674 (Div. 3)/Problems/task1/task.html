  <p>Vasya goes to visit his classmate Petya. Vasya knows that Petya's apartment number is $n$. </p>
  <p>There is only one entrance in Petya's house and the distribution of apartments is the following: the first floor contains $2$ apartments, every other floor contains $x$ apartments each. Apartments are numbered starting from one, from the first floor. I.e. apartments on the first floor have numbers $1$ and $2$, apartments on the second floor have numbers from $3$ to $(x + 2)$, apartments on the third floor have numbers from $(x + 3)$ to $(2 \cdot x + 2)$, and so on.</p>
  <p>Your task is to find the number of floor on which Petya lives. Assume that the house is always high enough to fit at least $n$ apartments.</p>
  <p>You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.</p>

   Input
  </div>
  <p>The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.</p>
  <p>The only line of the test case contains two integers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \le n, x \le 1000$) — the number of Petya's apartment and the number of apartments on each floor of the house except the first one (there are two apartments on the first floor).</p>

  <p>Consider the first test case of the example: the first floor contains apartments with numbers $1$ and $2$, the second one contains apartments with numbers $3$, $4$ and $5$, the third one contains apartments with numbers $6$, $7$ and $8$. Therefore, Petya lives on the third floor.</p>
  <p>In the second test case of the example, Petya lives in the apartment $1$ which is on the first floor.</p>
