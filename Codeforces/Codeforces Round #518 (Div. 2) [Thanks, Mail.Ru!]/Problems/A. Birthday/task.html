   Note
  </div> 
  <p>In the first test, one coin from each friend is enough, as he will be presented with 15 different coins and 13 of them will definitely be new.</p> 
  <p>In the second test, Ivan has 11 friends, but there are only 10 different coins. So all friends can't present him different coins.</p>
