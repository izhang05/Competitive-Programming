  <p>Polycarp and his friends want to visit a new restaurant. The restaurant has $n$ tables arranged along a straight line. People are already sitting at some tables. The tables are numbered from $1$ to $n$ in the order from left to right. The state of the restaurant is described by a string of length $n$ which contains characters "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>" (the table is occupied) and "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">0</span>" (the table is empty).</p>
  <p>Restaurant rules prohibit people to sit at a distance of $k$ or less from each other. That is, if a person sits at the table number $i$, then all tables with numbers from $i-k$ to $i+k$ (except for the $i$-th) should be free. In other words, the absolute difference of the numbers of any two occupied tables must be strictly greater than $k$.</p>
  <p>For example, if $n=8$ and $k=2$, then:</p>
  <ul> 
   <li> strings "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">10010001</span>", "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">10000010</span>", "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">00000000</span>", "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">00100000</span>" satisfy the rules of the restaurant; </li>
   <li> strings "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">10100100</span>", "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">10011001</span>", "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">11111111</span>" do not satisfy to the rules of the restaurant, since each of them has a pair of "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>" with a distance less than or equal to $k=2$. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>In particular, if the state of the restaurant is described by a string without "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>" or a string with one "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>", then the requirement of the restaurant is satisfied.</p>
  <p>You are given a binary string $s$ that describes the current state of the restaurant. It is guaranteed that the rules of the restaurant are satisfied for the string $s$.</p>
  <p>Find the maximum number of free tables that you can occupy so as not to violate the rules of the restaurant. Formally, what is the maximum number of "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">0</span>" that can be replaced by "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>" such that the requirement will still be satisfied?</p>
  <p>For example, if $n=6$, $k=1$, $s=$&nbsp;"<span class="tex-font-style-tt">100010</span>", then the answer to the problem will be $1$, since only the table at position $3$ can be occupied such that the rules are still satisfied.</p>

  <p>The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$)&nbsp;— the number of test cases in the test. Then $t$ test cases follow.</p>
  <p>Each test case starts with a line containing two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le k \le n \le 2\cdot 10^5$)&nbsp;— the number of tables in the restaurant and the minimum allowed distance between two people.</p>
  <p>The second line of each test case contains a binary string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">0</span>" and "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>"&nbsp;— a description of the free and occupied tables in the restaurant. The given string satisfy to the rules of the restaurant&nbsp;— the difference between indices of any two "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>" is more than $k$.</p>
  <p>The sum of $n$ for all test cases in one test does not exceed $2\cdot 10^5$.</p>

  <p>For each test case output one integer&nbsp;— the number of tables that you can occupy so as not to violate the rules of the restaurant. If additional tables cannot be taken, then, obviously, you need to output $0$.</p>

  <p>The first test case is explained in the statement.</p>
  <p>In the second test case, the answer is $2$, since you can choose the first and the sixth table.</p>
  <p>In the third test case, you cannot take any free table without violating the rules of the restaurant.</p>
