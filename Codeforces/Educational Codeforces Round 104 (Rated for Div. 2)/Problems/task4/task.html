  <p>A Pythagorean triple is a triple of integer numbers $(a, b, c)$ such that it is possible to form a right triangle with the lengths of the first cathetus, the second cathetus and the hypotenuse equal to $a$, $b$ and $c$, respectively. An example of the Pythagorean triple is $(3, 4, 5)$.</p>
  <p>Vasya studies the properties of right triangles, and he uses a formula that determines if some triple of integers is Pythagorean. Unfortunately, he has forgotten the exact formula; he remembers only that the formula was some equation with squares. So, he came up with the following formula: $c = a^2 - b$.</p>
  <p>Obviously, this is not the right formula to check if a triple of numbers is Pythagorean. But, to Vasya's surprise, it actually worked on the triple $(3, 4, 5)$: $5 = 3^2 - 4$, so, according to Vasya's formula, it is a Pythagorean triple.</p>
  <p>When Vasya found the right formula (and understood that his formula is wrong), he wondered: how many are there triples of integers $(a, b, c)$ with $1 \le a \le b \le c \le n$ such that they are Pythagorean both according to his formula and the real definition? He asked you to count these triples.</p>

  <p>For each test case, print one integer — the number of triples of integers $(a, b, c)$ with $1 \le a \le b \le c \le n$ such that they are Pythagorean according both to the real definition and to the formula Vasya came up with.</p>

  <p>The only Pythagorean triple satisfying $c = a^2 - b$ with $1 \le a \le b \le c \le 9$ is $(3, 4, 5)$; that's why the answer for $n = 3$ is $0$, and the answer for $n = 6$ (and for $n = 9$) is $1$.</p>
